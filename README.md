# LAMMPS compute nonaffinity

LAMMPS compute to get the atomic shear nonaffinity.

## Installation

- Put the `\*.cpp` and `\*.h` in `USER-NONAFFINITY` to `LAMMPS/src` directory
- Compile LAMMPS with MKL lapack library. One may need to change LAMMPS Makefile. One Makefile I used is shown in `USER-NONAFFINITY`
